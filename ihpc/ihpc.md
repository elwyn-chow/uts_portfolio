#High Performance Cluster (iHPC)

##Introduction
Most of my web development work for UTS was for the Intranet and not publicly available. 

Some of the larger projects such as when I worked in UTS's Faculty of IT were also decommissioned over the years.

However, I do have screen caps of my most recent project for UTS: iHPC (High Performance Cluster). 

iHPC is a collection of high performance servers used by students to run computationally-intense calculations.

The website had two major components: the overview page and the content management system. 
It also had a smaller set of pages for the administrators of the web site and for users to configure their preferences.

##Overview Page

The overview page (see overview1.jpg to overview3.jpg) that displayed the details of each server and the name of each machine 
was a link that would open a NoMachine NXSession to the server, allowing students and staff to have a graphical connection. 
(The details for each machine was generated by a Java program then my PHP and jQuery code would refresh the contents of the web page 
without doing a full refresh. I'm particularly proud that the % images for CPU and memory load were generated using PHP and scalable vector graphics.)


2) a content management system developed in-house at the Faculty of Engineering and IT. My main role regarding that was maintenance of the code and adding a WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor). The CMS was used to share documentation on the software available to students and how to use them. (see sample documentation*.JPG)

There were also some smaller sections such as admin pages for debugging (see admin*.JPG) and preferences for storing user preferences (preferences*.JPG).

If you wish to discuss this or my other projects, I am available for a chat anytime after 1 pm weekdays on 0421-417-888.

Kind regards,
Elwyn
